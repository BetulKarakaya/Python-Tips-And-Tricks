            # Explanation:
            # - 'yield' is like a "pause and return" in a function.
            # - It doesn't terminate the function like 'return' but pauses it, saving the state.
            # - When the function is called again, it resumes from this exact point.
            # - This is especially useful for infinite or very large sequences where storing
            #   all values in memory at once would be inefficient.
