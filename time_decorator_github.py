"""Advanced Trick: A custom decorator to time function execution
This script demonstrates how to create and use a custom Python decorator to measure 
and display how long a function takes to execute. The `timer_decorator` wraps any 
function, prints a message before and after its execution, and reports the total 
duration in seconds. This technique is particularly useful for performance profiling, 
debugging bottlenecks, and optimizing time-consuming operations like data processing, 
API requests, file downloads, and more.

The `@wraps` from `functools` ensures that the metadata of the original function 
(e.g., its name and docstring) is preserved after decoration.

Example functions:
- `process_data`: Simulates a time-consuming task using `time.sleep`.
- `download_file`: Simulates a file download.

Run this script to see how the decorator tracks execution time for both tasks.
