| `For Loop`                                  | The for...else construct in Python allows you to pair a loop with an else block that executes only if the loop completes without hitting a break statement. This pattern can make code more readable by clearly distinguishing cases where a condition wasn't met during iteration. Here’s how it works: the else block runs if the loop completes all iterations without interruption; if a break is encountered, the else block is skipped. This is especially useful for search tasks, where break exits the loop if a match is found, and else handles the "no match found" case.                        | [for...else Loop](https://github.com/BetulKarakaya/Python-Tips-And-Tricks/blob/main/for_else_loop_github.py)       | Beginner      |
