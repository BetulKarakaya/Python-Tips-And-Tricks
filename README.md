| `For Loop`                                  | The for...else construct in Python allows you to pair a loop with an else block that executes only if the loop completes without hitting a break statement. This pattern can make code more readable by clearly distinguishing cases where a condition wasn't met during iteration. Here’s how it works: the else block runs if the loop completes all iterations without interruption; if a break is encountered, the else block is skipped. This is especially useful for search tasks, where break exits the loop if a match is found, and else handles the "no match found" case.                        | [for...else Loop](https://github.com/BetulKarakaya/Python-Tips-And-Tricks/blob/main/for_else_loop_github.py)       | Beginner      |

| `Dynamic Programming`                  | This code demonstrates two dynamic programming approaches for computing Fibonacci numbers: a top-down method with recursion and memoization, and a bottom-up iterative method for improved memory efficiency. | [Fibonacci Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/BetulKarakaya/Python-Tips-And-Tricks/blob/main/dynamic_programming_fibonacci_github.py)       | Advanced      |
| `Dynamic Programming`                  | This code uses dynamic programming (bottom-up tabulation) to solve the coin change problem. It finds the minimum number of coins needed to make a target amount, while also keeping track of which coins were used to reconstruct the final combination (e.g., 20 TL + 5 TL + 1 TL + 1 TL + 1 TL). | [Coin/Bill Solver](https://github.com/BetulKarakaya/Python-Tips-And-Tricks/blob/main/dynamic_programming_coin_github.py)       | Advanced  |
