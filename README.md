| `Function`                                  | A first-class function is a function treated as a first-class citizen, meaning it can be passed as an argument, returned from another function, and assigned to a variable, just like any other object. This enables flexible and dynamic programming, allowing functions to be used as building blocks within other functions or data structures.                                     | [First Class Function](https://github.com/BetulKarakaya/Python-Tips-And-Tricks/blob/main/first_class_function_github.py)       | Advanced      |
| `Memoization`                               | A closure is a function that "remembers" the environment in which it was created, retaining access to variables from its containing scope even after that scope has finished executing. Closures are often used to create factory functions and encapsulate state.                    | [Closures](https://github.com/BetulKarakaya/Python-Tips-And-Tricks/blob/main/closures_github.py)       | Advanced      |
| `Effective Use Of Memory`                   | Generators are a type of iterable in Python that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values, but unlike lists, they generate values on the fly using yield, which makes them memory-efficient. Instead of storing the entire sequence in memory, they produce one item at a time as needed. This is particularly useful for working with large datasets.                              | [Generators](https://github.com/BetulKarakaya/Python-Tips-And-Tricks/blob/main/generators_github.py)       | Advanced      |
| `Useful Function - exec()`                  | The exec() function in Python dynamically executes Python code passed as a string. It can be used to run code that is generated or stored at runtime, making it powerful but also potentially risky, as it can execute arbitrary code. It's typically used for tasks like dynamic code execution or creating code templates.                                      | [exec()](https://github.com/BetulKarakaya/Python-Tips-And-Tricks/blob/main/exec.py)       | Advanced      |
