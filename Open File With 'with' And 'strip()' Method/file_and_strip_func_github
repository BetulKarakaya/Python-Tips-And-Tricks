# Description for 'with' keyword: 
# In Python, the 'with' keyword is used to wrap the execution of a block of code with methods defined by a context manager.
# It ensures that the resource is properly managed, and it automatically closes the file when the block of code is exited.
# This is particularly useful for file handling, where it helps in preventing resource leaks and writing cleaner code.

# Description for 'strip()' function:
# The strip() method in Python is used to remove leading and trailing characters from a string. 
# By default, it removes whitespace characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, but you can also specify other characters to be removed.
# It's commonly used to clean up input data or to remove unnecessary whitespace from strings.

# Example code to read lines from a file and print them to the console using 'with' keyword and 'strip()' function:

with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(len(line))
        print(len(line.strip())) 
        # strip() method is used here to remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line before printing
